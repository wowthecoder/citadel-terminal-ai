# Citadel Europe Spring Terminal
This is the repository containing my algorithm for playing the Terminal game. This repo is cloned from the [starter kit](https://github.com/correlation-one/AIGamesStarterKit/tree/master/python-algo), and my code is in `my-algo2-2/algo-strategy.py`. The identically named file in the folder `my-algo2/` is my older version.
